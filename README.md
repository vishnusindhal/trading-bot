# trading-bot
A Telegram bot built using Node.js that allows users to interact with custom tokens on the blockchain. The bot facilitates actions like creating wallets, buying/selling tokens, checking balances, and ejecting private keys. It integrates with smart contracts for tokens and stores user data securely using MongoDB.

Features
Custom Token Integration: Supports seven custom tokens: USDC, USDT, BNB, WBTC, SHY, PEPE, and SHIB.
Wallet Generation: Automatically generates a public-private key pair for each user upon initialization.
Token Operations: Allows users to buy, sell, and check the balance of their tokens.
Private Key Management: Stores the private key in MongoDB and allows users to eject it securely.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend logic and Telegram bot server.
Foundry: Smart contract testing.
Solidity: Smart contract development for token management.
MongoDB: Database for storing user private keys.
Telegram API: For bot interaction.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Install Node.js (v14+).
MongoDB: Set up a MongoDB instance to store private keys.
Telegram Bot Token: Create a bot on Telegram using BotFather and get the token.
Foundry: Install Foundry for testing and deploying smart contracts.
Installation

git clone https://github.com/psg-19/DeFi_Telegram_BOT.git
cd test
Install dependencies:

cd BOT-Server
npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file and add the following:

BOT_API_KEY= < YOUR TELEGRAM BOT API KEY >
MONGO_DB= < YOUR MONGO DB CONNECTION STRING >
ALGORITHM= < Crypto Algorithm To use >
ENCRYPTION_KEY= < Crypto Encryption Key >
ENCRYPTION_IV=  < Crypto Encryption IV >
ALCHEMY_RPC= < Your Alchemy RPC URL Where Smart Contracts Are Deployed >
TOKEN_TO_SERVER_CONTRACT= <Address Of Token To Server contract >
TOKEN_TO_SERVER_CONTRACT_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY= < Address Of Owner Who Deployed Token To Server contract >

 
Setup Foundry

cd Smart_Contracts
npm i
forge Test
Deploy the smart contracts using Foundry:

forge create --rpc-url < Your Alchemy RPC URL >   --private-key <private key of yours>  src/<File name>.sol:<Function Name> --legacy --broadcast
Start the bot:
npm run build
npm start
Usage
/start: Initializes the bot, creates a public-private key pair, and stores the private key in MongoDB.
menu: Opens up menu for transaction.
help: Opens up help section.
Smart Contracts
Custom Tokens: USDC, USDT, BNB, WBTC, SHY, PEPE, SHIB smart contracts have been created and tested.
Master Contract: A smart contract that acts as the owner of all tokens and facilitates interaction with the Node.js server.
